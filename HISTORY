* Log SSH exceptions during indexing (when we're being verbose).
* This history file now exists (pre-populated).
* An actual README, courtesy of some prodding by Mislav.
* Added support for wordforms (automatically sent through to the server).

0.5.1 - 23rd June 2011
* Adding rake as a development dependency, just for Travis CI.
* Have a default database port - Cedar stack doesn't set it by default.
* Allow for newer net-ssh gem versions (including 2.1).

* Using Bundler as gem driver instead of Jeweler (Josh Kalderimis).
* More flexible JSON dependency.

0.4.4 - 7th February 2011
* Using ActiveRecord's connection information, as we can't rely on heroku_env.yml to be around.

0.4.3 - 4th February 2011
* Wait until the SSH session and forward is prepared before making the index request.
* If credentials are invalid, raise an appropriate error instead of letting the JSON parsing fail.

0.4.2 - 29th January 2011
* Set the Thinking Sphinx database adapter when loaded, instead of requiring the Rails dispatcher to setup.

0.4.1 - 24th January 2011
* Comparing against response bodies for consistency (and avoiding HTTParty magic).

0.4.0 - 18th January 2011
* Using HTTPS for API calls.

Note: Any releases before this were most definitely experimental and pre-alpha.
